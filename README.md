# Streamlit ChatBot to chat with my Master's final project!.

A **RAG powered** application built using LangChain and Ollama Models. It allows you to chat with my Master's Degree final project!.

Feel free to ask questions and contribute!

Technologies I used:
- `LangChain`.
- `Streamlit` for the frontend of the application.
- `Ollama` with llama3 model embeddings.
- `FAISS` local vectorstore.


# To test it yourself.

You should have OLLAMA installed and have pulled the llama3 model (`ollama pull llama3`).
After that, go to the folder of the repository and type: `streamlit run rag.py`
